This demo project shows how to make use of the machemu sdk to emulate an arcade machine, in this case, Space Invaders. It sets up and instance of Emulator::IMachine, adds the Space Invaders custom controllers and runs the machine for 10 seconds. When the run time is complete it writes the contents of the video memory to disk as a bitmap located in roms/ called invaders.bmp.

NOTE: Space Invaders ROM files are not supplied but can be easily obtained online. Once you have them place them in the roms directory. There should be 4 roms and the demo expects the e, f, g and h roms to be named invaders-e.bin, invaders-f.bin, invaders-g.bin and invaders-h.bin.

Basic principles of operation:

1. Determine the memory and io layout of the target application.

	See SpaceInvaders.ixx module documentation which documents the memory and io layout for Space Invaders.

2. Write a memory and io controller which targets the desire application.

	See SpaceInvaders.cpp for a custom memory and io controller targetting Space Invaders.

3. Register these controllers with an instance of Emulator::IMachine.

	See main.cpp for IMachine instatiation and controller registration.

4. Run the machine.

	Once the previous prequisties have been done, calling Emulator::IMachine::Run() will start the machine cpu execution loop.

Based on the principles of operation one can see how the machemu sdk can be used to create a multi machine arcade emulator.

1. Create an IMachine instance.
2. Register controllers for target application 'one'.
3. Run the machine for target application 'one' until an input device decides to exit the control loop.
4. When Run completes register controllers for target application 'two'.
5. Run the machine for target application 'two' until an input device decides to exit the control loop.
6. Repeat register and run sequence for n target applications.
